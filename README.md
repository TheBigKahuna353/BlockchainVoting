# Voting System using a blockchain

This project is a Python-based blockchain voting system designed to securely record and verify votes while ensuring data integrity and transparency. Each voter is assigned a unique voter_id upon registration, which is used for casting votes on the blockchain. Votes are stored as individual transactions within blocks, and nodes validate blocks to maintain consistency across the network. By leveraging blockchainâ€™s decentralized and immutable structure, the system prevents tampering, enables easy auditing of votes, and ensures that each voter can only vote once
 
# Privacy

Users register to receive a unique voter_id, which acts as their private identifier and should remain confidential. No personal information is required, ensuring that all votes are anonymous and privacy is preserved.

# Security

To ensure vote integrity and prevent tampering, each transaction (vote) on this blockchain system is secured using digital signatures. When users vote, their transaction includes a digital signature created with their unique private key, which authenticates their identity and verifies that they are authorized to submit the vote. Other nodes on the network can use the corresponding public key to validate this signature, confirming that the vote came from a legitimate source without revealing the voter's identity.

Additionally, each block references the hash of the previous block, making it impossible to alter a past block without invalidating the entire chain. This structure ensures that the blockchain maintains a trustworthy and immutable history of votes while preserving voter anonymity.

# Downfalls

This project is designed for small-scale use, so it has a few limitations:

- Limited Scalability: Currently, only one user registration can be processed at a time. Each registration requires network-wide block validation, so if another user tries to register while a registration block is still being mined, their registration attempt will fail. This limitation would become more problematic in larger networks.
- Potential Single Points of Failure: While decentralized, the network relies on a few nodes, which could impact reliability if any node goes offline.
- Currently there is potential for users to register multiple times, to solve this, a system that verifies identities upon registering and stores registered names to stop people registering with that name again.

This prototype is a foundation for understanding blockchain voting mechanics, with room for future scaling improvements and enhanced robustness.


# How to use

Start the app and press register. This will give you your voter id (your username), and your mnuemonic, which is your password, you can use this for future logins
To add a vote, 

# TODO
## networking
- abstract P2P into P2P and P2PNode (make P2P a standalone library?)
- more error/timeout catching, get rid of while not self.server_connected to take into account server errors
- login
- show votes
- be able to send purposely incorrect block to other nodes
